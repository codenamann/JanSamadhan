# Image Preview Setup Guide

## Current Implementation Status ✅

The image preview functionality has been fully implemented with the following features:

### 1. **ImagePreview Component** ✅
- **Location**: `client/src/components/ui/ImagePreview.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Multiple preview formats (base64, blob URL)
  - Automatic fallback system
  - Upload progress indicators
  - Error handling and retry functionality
  - Multiple size options (small, medium, large)
  - Proper memory cleanup

### 2. **Camera Integration** ✅
- **Location**: `client/src/components/Camera/CameraCapture.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Captures images and creates File objects
  - Generates multiple preview formats
  - Proper camera retake functionality
  - Memory management

### 3. **ReportIssue Integration** ✅
- **Location**: `client/src/pages/citizen/ReportIssue.jsx`
- **Features**:
  - Uses ImagePreview component for all image displays
  - Automatic Cloudinary upload on form submission
  - Backend API integration
  - Proper error handling

### 4. **Backend Support** ✅
- **Image Storage**: Cloudinary URLs stored in database
- **API Endpoints**: Full CRUD operations for images
- **Database Schema**: Updated to handle image URLs and metadata

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory:

```env
# Cloudinary Configuration
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset

# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 2. Cloudinary Setup
1. Create a Cloudinary account
2. Get your cloud name, API key, and API secret
3. Create an unsigned upload preset
4. Add the credentials to your environment variables

## How It Works

### Image Capture Flow:
1. **Camera Capture** → Creates File object + blob URL preview
2. **ImagePreview Component** → Shows immediate preview using blob URL
3. **Form Submission** → Automatically uploads to Cloudinary
4. **Backend Storage** → Stores Cloudinary URL in database

### Preview System:
- **Primary**: Blob URL for immediate display
- **Fallback**: Base64 if blob URL fails
- **Error Handling**: Shows error message with retry option
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of blob URLs

### Upload System:
- **Automatic**: Uploads happen on form submission
- **Progress**: Shows loading indicators during upload
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling
- **Backend Integration**: Full API integration
