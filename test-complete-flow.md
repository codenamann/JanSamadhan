# Complete Authority Authentication Flow Test

## üß™ Testing Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
1. Create `server/.env` with the variables from `env.md`
2. Create `client/.env` with `VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:5000`
3. Start MongoDB: `mongod` (or `brew services start mongodb-community` on macOS)

### 2. Start the Application
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Server
cd server
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Client  
cd client
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Super Admin Panel
1. Visit `http://localhost:5173/superadmin`
2. Add a new authority:
   - Name: "Test Authority"
   - Email: "test@authority.com"
   - Department: "Public Works"
   - Designation: "Engineer"
   - Phone: "+91-9876543210"
3. Click "Add Authority"
4. Verify the authority appears in the list

### 4. Test Authority Login Flow
1. Visit `http://localhost:5173/authority/login`
2. Enter email: "test@authority.com"
3. Click "Send OTP"
4. Check server console for OTP code (e.g., "üîê OTP Code: 123456")
5. Enter the 6-digit OTP
6. Click "Verify OTP"
7. Should redirect to authority dashboard

### 5. Test Authority Dashboard
1. Should see "Test Authority - Public Works" in header
2. Should see logout button
3. Should see dashboard content

### 6. Test OTP Email (if Brevo configured)
1. Check email inbox for OTP email
2. Email should have JanSamadhan branding
3. Should contain the same OTP as console

## üîç Expected Console Output

### Server Console
```
‚úÖ MongoDB Connected: localhost
üöÄ Server running on port 5000
üìß Sending OTP email to: test@authority.com
üîê OTP Code: 123456
‚úÖ Authority login successful: test@authority.com
```

### Client Console
```
‚úÖ Socket.io connected
‚úÖ Authority registered successfully
‚úÖ Login successful!
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. MongoDB Connection Error**
```
Error: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017
```
**Solution**: Start MongoDB service

**2. CORS Error**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:5000' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy
```
**Solution**: Check CORS_ORIGINS in server/.env

**3. API Connection Error**
```
Failed to fetch
```
**Solution**: Check VITE_SERVER_URL in client/.env

**4. OTP Not Working**
```
Invalid OTP. Please try again
```
**Solution**: Check server console for correct OTP code
